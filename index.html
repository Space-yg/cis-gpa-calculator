            <!-- Usage -->
            <h1>How to use the calculator?</h1>
            <p>
                Choose your grade and enter the grades for each subject.
            </p>
            <!-- GPA -->
            <h1>What is GPA?</h1>
            <p>
                GPA stands for Grade Average Point. It is a form of way to
                evaluate grades. It is usually used on a 4.0 scaling point,
                meaning that the GPA is calculated out of 4.
            </p>
            <!-- CGPA -->
            <h1>What is CGPA?</h1>
            <p>
                CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Average Point. It is the
                average of all GPAs achieved. For example, CGPA can be
                calculated by getting the average between the first school
                term and the second school term GPAs. Another example is
                getting the average GPA from grade 9 through 12.
            </p>
            <!-- Weighted GPA vs. Unweighted GPA -->
            <h1>
                What is the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Weighted GPA gives more grades to AP, honors, IB, and
                college classes. Unweighted GPA does not give any more
                grades to them. Weighted GPA gives 0.5 GPA more to honors
                classes and 1 GPA more to AP, IB, and college classes.
                Capital International Schools does not provide weighted
                GPA, but gives 10% more for AP classes.
            </p>
            <!-- Calculate Unweighted GPA -->
            <h1>How do you calculate unweighted GPA?</h1>
            <p>
                The calculation is actually simple.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get the grade percentage or letter of each class
                        and use the Grade's Key to get each class's GPA.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multiply each GPA by the amount of credit of the
                        class. Each class is usually 1 credit hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add all the GPAs of all the classes together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Divide the sum by the total of credit hours taken.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Voila! You have your GPA!
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <!-- Calculate Weighted GPA -->
            <h1>How do you calculate weighted GPA?</h1>
            <p>
                Do the same calculation for as the unweighted GPA, but make
                sure that after step 1 you add 0.5 GPA to honors classes
                and 1 GPA to AP, IB, or college classes. Capital
                International Schools does not provide weighted GPA, but
                gives 10% more for AP classes.
            </p>
            <!-- AP -->
            <h1>What is AP?</h1>
            <p>
                AP stands for Advanced Placement. It is an series of exams
                made by the <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/">

                exchanged fro college credits. For more information, visit
